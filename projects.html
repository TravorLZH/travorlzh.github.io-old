<h2><a href="https://github.com/TravorLZH/LearnOS">OS Tutorial</a></h2>
This repo is a mirror of my work in study of Operating System. You may build those code by <b>make</b> or using <b>nasm -fbin foo.asm -o bar.bin</b> I hope the code would help more people in learning of Operating System. I also put the document <b>os-dev.pdf</b> that I learned OS from in the root directory.
