<h3><a href="https://github.com/TravorLZH/OS">TravorOS: Developing with simplification</a></h3>
This is the first operating system I created<br/>
<pre><code class="x86asm">
	mov	ax,0x7C0; Set the data segment from
	mov	ds,ax	; where we start
	mov	bx,msg
	call	print_string	; Call the print string
				; routine we created
	jmp	$		; Hang...
	msg	db	"Hello world!",0

print_string:
	mov	ah,0x0E	; BIOS print char function
.repeat:
	mov	al,[bx]	; load character from string
	inc	bx		; Increment the address
	cmp	al,0	; Check if the character is valid
	je	.done	; If yes, end of string
	jmp	.repeat	; If not, get the next one
.done:
	ret

	times	510-($-$$)	db	0
	dw	0xAA55	; Standard boot sector signature
</code></pre>
It inherits the kerneltest32 section of <a href="https://github.com/TravorLZH/LearnOS">OS Tutorial</a>. This will be continuously developed. I finally decided to use 32-bit protected mode to boot this OS, because it allows me to write kernel in C like this:<br/>
<pre><code class="cpp">
#include &lt;basic.h&gt;

int main(void){
	puts("Hello world!");
}

</code></pre>
But I am not capable of using the standard C library in this kernel because my operating system doesn't implement those code. Even the entry of the kernel is written by myself!<br/>
<pre><code class="x86asm">
; Ensures that we jump straight into the kernel's entry function.
[bits	32]
[extern	main]	; Declare that we will be referencing
		;the external symbol 'main'
call	main
jmp	$
</code></pre>

This repo is a mirror of my work in study of Operating System. You may build those code by <i>make</i> or using <i>nasm -fbin foo.asm -o bar.bin</i> I hope the code would help more people in learning of Operating System. I also put the document <i>os-dev.pdf</i> that I learned OS from in the root directory.
