<h3><a href="https://github.com/TravorLZH/TravorOS">TravorOS: Developing with simplification</a></h3>
This is the first operating system I created<br/>
<pre><code class="x86asm">
	mov	ax,0x7C0; Set the data segment from
	mov	ds,ax	; where we start
	mov	bx,msg
	call	print_string	; Call the print string
				; routine we created
	jmp	$		; Hang...
	msg	db	"Hello world!",0

print_string:
	mov	ah,0x0E	; BIOS print char function
.repeat:
	mov	al,[bx]	; load character from string
	inc	bx		; Increment the address
	cmp	al,0	; Check if the character is valid
	je	.done	; If yes, end of string
	jmp	.repeat	; If not, get the next one
.done:
	ret

	times	510-($-$$)	db	0
	dw	0xAA55	; Standard boot sector signature
</code></pre>
It inherits the kerneltest32 section of <a href="https://github.com/TravorLZH/LearnOS">OS Tutorial</a>. This will be continuously developed. I finally decided to use 32-bit protected mode to boot this OS, because it allows me to write kernel in C like this:<br/>
<pre><code class="cpp">
#include &lt;basic.h&gt;

int main(void){
	puts("Hello world!");
}

</code></pre>
But I am not capable of using the standard C library in this kernel because my operating system doesn't implement those code. Even the entry of the kernel is written by myself!<br/>
<pre><code class="x86asm">
; Ensures that we jump straight into the kernel's entry function.
[bits	32]
[extern	main]	; Declare that we will be referencing the external symbol 'kernel_main'
call	main
jmp	$

<h3><a href="https://github.com/TravorLZH/LearnOS">OS Tutorial</a></h3>
This repo is a mirror of my work in study of Operating System. You may build those code by 'make' or using 'nasm -fbin foo.asm -o bar.bin'. I hope these codes would help more people learn Operating System. I also put the document 'os-dev.pdf' that I learned OS from in the root directory.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/TravorLZH/libwinfork">libwinfork: implementation of fork on Windows</a></h3>
This is the first program I wrote with fork();
<br/>
<pre><code class="cpp">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(void){
    pid_t pid=fork();
    if(pid==0){
        printf("I am the child procss!\n");
    }else if(pid>0){
        printf("I am the parent process, the child pid is %d\n",pid);
    }else{
        perror("ERROR");
        return -1;
    }
    return 0;
}

</code></pre>
As you can see, this program may only work on UN*X systems and Windows with MSYS or CYGWIN, but my library will implement this function on Windows environment. This will allow most linux source code to be built and run properly on Windows.
