GLUTCraft
====
##### GLUTCraft: A 3D Minecraft-Like Game developed in C with [FreeGLUT](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download "Download FreeGLUT").
I would append more introduction when I update some major features.
I can promise this project won't be in `/dev/null`
This project can be successfully made on windows. If you're using [Linux](http://www.kernel.org/), You had better to modify `CMakeLists.txt` because it's for Windows.
