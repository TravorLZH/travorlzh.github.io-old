# Travor Liu's Github Page

This is my first successful repository about CSS because I really worked a lot on it. You can tell them from the final website. It has navigation bar and code board.

## Navigation Tabs

- `POSTS`: The Posts sorted by posted date are listed here.

- `PROJECTS`: All repo I created and at least 1 code board for each.

- `LABS`: I would like to put my in-testing html pages. I'm currently working on Responsive Layout.

## Help Wanted

My website has been very beautiful on mobile device since the recent commits. But now I got mad on the desktop design. I want somebody to join me to help develop the design.
