# Travor Liu's Github Page

This is my first successful repository about CSS because I really worked a lot on it. You can tell them from the final website. It has navigation bar and code board.

#### Navigation Tabs

- `HOME`: I haven't got any idea to put on it. Perhaps major projects?

- `PROJECTS`: All repo I created and at least 1 code board for each.

- `LABS`: I would like to put my in-testing html pages. I'm currently working on Responsive Layout.
